## Algorithms

**Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search:**

&emsp; Used structure for graph for BFS and DFS algorithms is adjacency lists. The example graph in `main` is: 
<pre>
        1------2------3
        |  __/        |
        4 /           5
        |
        6-----7
        |
        8
</pre>
